\subsection{Web scrapping with CSS selector}
I scrapped a Wikipedia page that has a table of all the countries and information on whether U.S. passport holders need a visa or not, the type of visa they will need, and the length of the visa if applicable. This data will be useful for me at some point because I love traveling and I am planning to travel as much as possible. Therefore this table will be useful for me to know if I will be needing a visa or not and be prepared. I did not use any online tutorial, I used the steps we did in class.

\subsection{API access}
 I used IMdB API to see the different movies and ratings because I love watching movies. I used jsonlite and httr packages. I found that 'The Shawshank Redemption' was the number 1 ranked movie.
